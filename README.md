Hello! Welcome to my Python Challenge Repo!

See files for PyPoll and PyBank scripts, resource csvs', and analysis files created by each code respectivelly in their respective folders.

PyPoll: This assignment reviews election data and computes:
- Total casted ballots
- Total ballots
- Percentage of votes by each of three candidates
- Winning candidate based on vote results

PyBank: This assignment reviews a file of budget data for a company across a period of time. My script analyzes this file and returns values for: 
- Total number of months in the period

- Changes in profit/loss for the period
- Greatest increase/decrease in profits and their respective dates


Thank you very much!
